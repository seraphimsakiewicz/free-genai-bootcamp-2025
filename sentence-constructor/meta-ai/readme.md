- I chatted with Meta AI LLaMa 3, their 70 billion paramter version
- overall it was kind of a pain to work with it, and took way longer than I wished, but maybe it's
  because I was expecting to much of it.
- metaAI was a pain to prompt properly
- it kept giving me overly complex sentence structures
- it would use suggestions as justification to mark answers wrong such as "a mi me gusta" instead it
  should be "me gusta"
- going back i think maybe an examples prompt.txt would have maybe steered it better than the
  verbose document i used
- i'm curious to see how other chat assistants do with this prompt document.
