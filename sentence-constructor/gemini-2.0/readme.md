# Gemini 2.0 AI Guide

## Model

I decided to use Google Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite for this prompt testing scenario to see if it would
manage to perform well at such a low cost. For testing they offer the API completely free of charge
and their pay as you go pricing is very generous of $0.075 per 1 million tokens. I'll primarily use
Flash-Lite, but I'll see how the other 2.0 models are too.

## Chat Assistant

I used https://t3.chat/chat and set it to flash lite preview there.

For some reason, Google only wants you to try Flash Lite in their AI studio which gives you more
control than we need for the scope of this assignment.
