# ChatGPT AI Guide

## Model

I decided to ultimately use the GPT 4o because it's a good low cost comparison to MetaAI
I have the paid version of ChatGPT and I was able to compare the different models.

GPT 4o - Provided the best output in terms of speed, quality, and cost
GPT o3-mini - Did not meet expectations, produced weird output, and was slower and more costly.
GPT o1 - Not good, because it gives you the answer as it's thinking, also it slower and the most
expensive model at the moment, there's a 50 a week query limit on my current plan
