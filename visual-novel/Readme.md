## Background Image Generatation

Amazon Nova Canvas generated decent background images. It could generate anime style but I didn't like the stylization

SDXL was not very good at generating images.

Grok 3 despite being difficult to prompt generated very good backgrounds but would not do them in anime style.

Even though Grok 3 has no API I'll likey generate the background images via Grok 3 and maybe apply a styling filter with another service.
