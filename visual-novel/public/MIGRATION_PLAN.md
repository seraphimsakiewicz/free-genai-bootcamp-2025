# Game Refactoring Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a step-by-step plan for migrating the current monolithic GameScene.js to a more modular structure with specialized components.

## Directory Structure Created
```
/public/lib/
  /ui/           - UI-related components
  /dialog/     - Dialog system
  /characters/   - Character management
  /save/         - Save/load functionality
  /input/        - Input handling
  /audio/        - Audio management
  /settings/     - Game settings management
  /utils/        - Helper functions and utilities
```

## Modules Created

### Core Systems

1. **UIManager** (`/lib/ui/UIManager.js`)
   - Manages all UI components including dialog box, choice buttons, and control panels
   - Handles UI layout and positioning

2. **NotificationManager** (`/lib/ui/NotificationManager.js`)
   - Handles in-game notifications and messages
   - Manages notification display, positioning, and animations

3. **DialogManager** (`/lib/dialog/DialogManager.js`)
   - Handles dialog display, progression, and choices
   - Manages typing effects and dialog state

4. **CharacterManager** (`/lib/characters/CharacterManager.js`)
   - Handles character and background display
   - Manages character animations and transitions

5. **SaveManager** (`/lib/save/SaveManager.js`)
   - Manages game save/load functionality
   - Handles persistent game state

6. **InputManager** (`/lib/input/InputManager.js`)
   - Handles keyboard and mouse input
   - Sets up event listeners and key bindings

7. **AudioManager** (`/lib/audio/AudioManager.js`)
   - Manages background music and sound effects
   - Controls audio volumes and playback

8. **SettingsManager** (`/lib/settings/SettingsManager.js`)
   - Handles game settings and preferences
   - Provides UI for changing settings

### Utility Systems

9. **EventBus** (`/lib/utils/EventBus.js`)
   - Provides a communication channel between modules
   - Implements a publish/subscribe pattern for decoupled communication

10. **AssetLoader** (`/lib/utils/AssetLoader.js`)
    - Helper methods for loading game assets
    - Handles loading bars and progress tracking

11. **SceneTransition** (`/lib/utils/SceneTransition.js`)
    - Handles transitions between game scenes
    - Provides various transition effects (fade, slide, zoom)

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Begin Using Modules in GameScene
1. First integrate the event bus system to facilitate communication between modules
2. Test with the current `GameScene.js` importing and using these modules one by one
3. Gradually transition functionality from the monolithic approach to the modular one

### Step 2: Testing Individual Components
1. Test each component in isolation with simple test cases
2. Verify that each component functions as expected
3. Test communication between components via the event bus

### Step 3: Replacing GameScene.js
Once all modules are tested and working correctly, replace the current `GameScene.js` with the refactored version (`GameScene.refactored.js`).

### Step 4: Resolving Module Dependencies
Make sure all modules correctly reference each other through the scene object (e.g., `this.scene.uiManager`).

### Step 5: Cleanup
Remove any duplicate code and ensure all functionality is properly migrated.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**: Test each module individually
2. **Integration Testing**: Test modules working together in various combinations
3. **System Testing**: Test the complete game with all modules integrated
4. **Functional Testing**: Verify all game functionality works as expected:
   - Dialog progression and choices
   - Character display and transitions
   - Game controls (auto, skip, save, load)
   - Audio playback and control
   - Settings and preferences

## Long-term Improvements

1. Add additional character features like expressions and animations
2. Enhance dialog system with more text effects
3. Improve settings menu with more options
4. Implement a chapter selection screen
5. Add localization support for multiple languages
6. Implement an achievement system
7. Add cloud save functionality

## Notes
This modular approach will make future enhancements easier and keep the codebase organized and maintainable. It also facilitates:

- Easier testing and debugging
- Better code reuse across different projects
- Simpler onboarding for new developers
- Clearer separation of concerns
